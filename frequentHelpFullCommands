# Some helpful  commands , while working with LocalGitRepository.
# You should Read "  HitchHikers Guide To Galaxy "   , Por Que  , PorQue  es divertido!!!!.

# Sorry , Where were we ? .  Ha  Commands !.


# So see these are commands , That's cool. 


# Commands - 

# To roll back one commit-back  in gitLocally
# '$' is the terminal , don't include it  while executing the commands. 





1 ~ $git reset --hard HEAD^                              // If you committed something else you didn't wanted to  , you can always rollback to your previous commit, "Kudos!". 



# To Delete a specific Directory inside the repository. 


2 ~

    $git rm -r folderName 
    $git status                                           // ( just to check if it worked , nothing fancy ) 
    $git commit -a -m “anyMessagedYouWantToWriteInHere”   //-a stands for all ( i think )  -m stands for  Message, and message should be in double quotation's
    $git push origin master                               // The actual magic , to make changes to remote repository. 
                                                          // Sometimes there might be some diverging and merging errors  , that you can sort out. 



# Name of Files with spaces 

example : 

Assignment 1
php html  
et cetera .  

When you name any directory or files don't add spaces in actual name and when you do so  , you might be doing this , 
so when  using  any command   i will give error like 

cd Assignment 1  // This won't work 
git rm -r Assignment 1 // This also won't work 

because spaces is taken as another argument w.r.t that specific  command in terminal . 

So use "" double quotations while  working with  names with spaces 

cd "Assignment 1" // This will work 

git rm -r "Assignment 1" // Surely work . 


//These   small problems  are like  mites ,  eats your brain. ( make sure you know ) 


# So what will you do you ,  when you made a change  in your repository on remote on web . 
# you see your local repository , there's no changes reflected , so to do so .




3 ~ Pull Request , which is exact opposite of  "Push" . Here we are retrieving the repository from remote to our local with  all the changes .
   // You only execute  Pull when you think there  are some changes on remote you NEED , to your local-to work upon.
   
   $git pull --all         // This command will retrieve  the whole repository with all the changes , * while using command in the terminal make sure you are in your  repository.
                           // If you wish to retrieve a specific  branch and not other , there are commands to do . I haven't done that yet. 
                           

4 ~ switching between branches 
	
   $git status  			// Just to check were you are now 
   $git checkout nameOfTheBranch 	// That's it . if you are on any branch and you want to switch just this command and the name of your branch.


5 ~  To delete a directory  & to create a file and a directory ( folder ) 
   
   $mkdir test    	    // name the directory you want to create 
   $cd directoryName	    // changed to  directory 'test'
   $touch  test.txt         //  created a test.txt inside  'test' directory 
   
   # After pushing the directory to remote ,  then try deleting it. 

   $git rm -r test          // This command will delete the test directory  , '-r' stands for recursive .
    
   # And then again commit and push , in order to check . 	   
	




 #GoodDay.
