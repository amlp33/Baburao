 # few help full commands that might help you while working with  gitLocalRepository . 



To roll back one commit-back  in gitLocally

Command - 

git reset --hard HEAD^  
git push -f

for me it worked , but instead it created a duplicate of it . ( because it renamed a folder and then i commited  because of that one more folder with same files  

but with changed name  created , so then i have to browse and look for another command to delete a directory so  i found one )


so i just  did this command and then deleted the duplicate directory  by  using 

command ~ 

git rm -r folderName 
git status                        // ( just to check it worked ) 
git commit -a -m “anyMessagedYouWantToWriteInHere”   // In quotation's  
git push origin master 



Done.
